# SafeAutoKata
Using a .NET framework and C# built this console application.
The application takes in diffrent commands from a .txt file and averages the speed as well as the distance each driver traveled.  
I used seperation of concerns to make sure the data was seperate from other data and would stay attached to the driver it was assigned too.  
There is a .txt file attached to this project that can be used for testing.
